This repository contains the example code for my book "Using Sensors with the Raspberry Pi Pico". This book is available at https://leanpub.com/picosensors.

The examples are available for four programming environments:

* The official C/C++ SDK. The examples were tested with SDK version 1.5.0
* Arduino IDE with the unofficial support developed by Earle F. Philhower, III. The examples were tested with IDE v2.1.0 and Raspberry Pi Pico/RP2040 v3.2.2.
* MicroPython. The examples were tested with version 1.20.0.
* CircuitPython. The examples were tested with version 8.0.5.

Information on these environments can be found in the book.

The directory organization for the repository is environment/chapter/examples. Depending on the environment and example the example can be a single file or a directory.
